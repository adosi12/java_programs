/*Important points to remember about throws keyword: 

throws keyword is required only for checked exception and usage of throws keyword for unchecked exception is meaningless.
throws keyword is required only to convince compiler and usage of throws keyword does not prevent abnormal termination of program.
By the help of throws keyword we can provide information to the caller of the method about the exception.*/

// Java program to demonstrate working of throws
class ThrowsExecp
{
	static void fun() throws IllegalAccessException
	{
		System.out.println("Inside fun(). ");
		throw new IllegalAccessException("demo");
	}
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		try
		{
			fun();
		}
		catch(IllegalAccessException e)
		{
			System.out.println("caught in main.");
		}
	}
}
/*Output: 

Inside fun().
caught in main.*/
